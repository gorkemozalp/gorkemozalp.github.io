    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Gorkem Ozalp is a London-based guitarist, composer, and bandleader whose music bridges jazz, contemporary improvisation, and global influences.

Earlier this year, Ozalp released his debut EP Addresses, a collection of works reflecting his journey between Istanbul and London. The EP is available on all major streaming platforms and has been accompanied by live performances across London, including appearances with his trio at cultural venues and festivals.

In performance, Ozalp leads the Gorkem Ozalp Trio, featuring bassist Costa Tancredi and drummer Burak Ersöz. Together, the trio explores a dynamic and modern jazz sound while maintaining deep roots in improvisation and storytelling. 

Alongside his performing career, Ozalp is also active as an educator, working as a guitar teacher in schools across South West London, where he shares his expertise and passion for music with younger generations.
